I just finished reading Solr 1.4 Enterprise Search Server book by David Smiley and Eric Pugh. Quality stuff there. I used Solr in couple of projects but I wanted to go a bit further then regular use. Im easily forget how Lucena search is powerful and how it can be with Solr can be easily leveraged to create responsive searches.

I plan in further project to try <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elastic Search</a>, cause for now I used Solr to search on data set that wasn't updated often. I hope to test some claims from this great article regarding realtime search.
