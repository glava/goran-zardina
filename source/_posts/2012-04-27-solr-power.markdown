I just finished reading <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/solr-1-4-enterprise-search-server/book">Solr 1.4 Enterprise Search Server</a> book by David Smiley and Eric Pugh. Quality stuff there. I used Solr in couple of projects but I wanted to go a bit further then regular use. Im easily forget how Lucena search is powerful and how it can be with Solr can be easily leveraged to create responsive searches.
<!-- more -->
I plan in further project to try <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elastic Search</a>, cause for now I used Solr to search on data set that wasn't updated often. I hope to test some claims from this great article <a href="http://engineering.socialcast.com/2011/05/realtime-search-solr-vs-elasticsearch/">regarding realtime search</a>.
